- another ISV ship finds the "space gun"
  => people, equipment abruptly disappearing while investigating the gun
  => gun not in operational form

- adam & chali + denis & planet populate "the planet"
  => decide on a name
  => planet hears other ISV's broadcast (or space gun's broadcast in response to other ISV's presence) and travels to space gun
  => the reason the planet goes to the space gun is that the race that built the space gun was responsible for the "bug" in the code
     that resulted in integration to fail catastrophically. when the other ISV ship reaches the space gun and inadvertantly activates
     it, the planet detects subtle changes in the "harmonics of space" or somesuch -- an "alarm system"
  => eventually, denis finds a way to "unintegrate" people, reconstituting them, possibly with help from the progenitors on the other side of the space gun

- earth system's economy fails
  => virtually nobody left with the resources to create ship-size space bubble generators
  => hacking of nanohulls in order to steal bubble generators
  => a nanohull earth ship survives because a hacker with Denis-like abilities is on board, fighting the attackers
  => the hull freezes solid, but stops accepting ANY commands, leaving them on an oddly-shaped ship with some inaccessible compartments
  => *that* ship is what goes to the space gun

- earth expedition meets up with and/or finds "the planet" at the space gun
  => secretly developed weapons
  => attempts to take control of the planet

- to be revealed: why the progenitors were so afraid of the planet people that they hacked their integration process and fled the galaxy (femtotech?)

- ???

- profit!
